# TopoBrainV24 

Neural Network architecture, which implements a neuro-inspired learning system combining convolutional visual processing with adaptive topological dynamics, dual memory timescales, and meta-learning control.

TopoBrainV24 is designed for robust image classification with adversarial defense capabilities, implemented in a single Python file (app.py) as the core executable component of the TopoBrain repository.

## System Architecture Overview
TopoBrainV24 implements a biologically-inspired architecture with four major subsystems operating in concert:

- Visual Processing: ResNet18-based feature extraction
- Topological Processing: Two layers of adaptive combinatorial complex layers
- Meta-Learning Control: PrefrontalOrchestrator for homeostatic regulation
- Dual Readout: Cognitive and reflex pathways for robust classification
